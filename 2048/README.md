# 2048 Game Script
---
This Script simply uses *Selenium* module to open up the official game on
[https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

This script plays the game on it's own as many number of times as the user wants and returns the highest score recorded throughout the haul.

1. To run this script, first clone the repository as follows,

```     git clone -b <name-of-branch> git@github.com:2knal/Python-Scripts.git ```

2. Now, run this command in the terminal to run the script (First change directory to the Downloaded-Repo/2048),

```     python 2048.py <input-for-no-of-turns-to-be-played> ```



*Happy Coding! :smile:*
